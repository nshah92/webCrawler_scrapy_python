Just lack of interest even though I have many reasons to be interested such as a very attractive new girl friend. Hopefully getting off of this medication will help.

"User Reviews & Ratings - atenolol oral","Tenormin","I have taken this medication for years for Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome (POTS), which causes a drop in BP and rapid heartbeat upon standing. My fludrocortisone was not completely effective in eliminating my dizzy spells, so the atenolol was added and it made a big difference. However, I immediately started having very weird, vivid dreams. I didn't even know that it was a symptom until my cardiologist informed me that it was. I NEVER have side effects from any medications, so at first it was just a humorous thing, that I would manage to have such a strange side effect. I was okay with it, and the atenolol remained very effective even once I was taken off my fludrocortisone. I have been on atenolol alone to treat my POTS for years with the only problem being those pesky dreams. However, a couple of years ago I started having very horrible, vivid, TERRIFYING nightmares; I have woken up crying several times. Mmy frequent dreams have me waking up multiple times in the night, whether they are good or bad. I'm really tired (literally) of not getting a good night's rest, so my doctor is currently sampling me on a newer beta-blocker in hopes that I won't have the weird side effect. Overall, this medication has been great and very effective for me personally, I just can't stand the sleep disturbances anymore!"

"atenolol oral","Tenormin","Dreadful stuff. I am prescribed for Atenolol now which slowed my pulse so badly my poor heart had to pump even harder because I am a very active person. My BP just went higher - so the dose was doubled!!! I felt dreadful. Hair loss; arrhythmias; terrible mental agitation; sleeplessness; thickening facial skin; fingernails cracking; dizziness; etc as well as my son finding a reference to an 8% higher risk of cancer. Started to get depressed. Went back to GP who said it was normal to be on more than one type of drug so might need to start something else to make me feel better!!!! I said ""no"".

As I noticed I felt well when I forgot the tablets (the torturous mental agitation lessesned) For 3 months now I have gone on to Co enzyme Q10 and fish oils and I feel well again and my pulse has risen to normal and my BP has returned to normal and the arrhythmias have stopped - only on that. I am waiting to see if the hair loss improves but my nails seem better the longer I leave it.

"atenolol oral","Tenormin","The effectiveness of many medications is such a trade off between the obvious effect (the good thing) and the side effects or negative stuff, which can be many. The cold hands and feet in the beginning of treatment with atenolol or tenormin as I new it 30 years ago tells us what? That something is just not completely correct here but your body is amazing and it adjusts, your body can adjust to many things that might not be totally good for you. I am not belittling atenolol because I believe the overall good for me as far as blood pressure is concerned  is a good thing. I do believe that it has contributed to ED and fatigue, but whats the trade off? again...Life is never perfect and my wife who has heart issues and POTS and other things has been prescribed medicine time and time again but ends up never taking anything. My take on it is she skips the effects and goes right to the side effects. Its quite a phenomena. For me I would like to try a new blood pressure medicine but after so much time, don't know if its worth it. Although.....I believe that sex and love and the ability to perform is life and without it, well, it has a psychological effect on you.. In the end a beta blocker and an aspirin will probably save my life one day only to linger on for another day... HaH! I am being melodramatic, what can I say , I guess thats just me.....:)"

It helped as far as keeping my blood pressure and heart rate down, but not long after taking it I started having some major problems with Acid Reflux. I also had severe Esophageal Spasms almost the entire time I was taking this medicine, and thought it was heart related. It felt like a painful fluttering in the left side of my chest. The whole time I was on this medicine I went between my PCP, an ENT Specialist with Reflux problems, as well as a trip to the ER when the Esophageal Spasms got very bad one night and I thought I was having a heart attack. The ER actually increased my dosage of Atenolol! None of the doctors I saw ever realized the problem I was having was a side effect of Atenolol. I finally stopped taking this medicine on my own after doing a lot of research and reading that the problems I was having with Reflux ""could be"" a side effect of it. A few weeks after being off of it my Reflux started to improve and the Esophageal Spasms went away entirely. I know this medicine was the cause, because a week ago my heart started racing again and my BP was elevated, so I gave in and tried to go back on the Atenolol. After only 2 doses I had painful Esophageal Spasms again. I will be scheduling a follow up with my doctor ASAP to see what else I might try to take in place of the Atenolol. "

Dr. never addressed my concern for coughing and lightheadedness, only prescribed a nausea med and prescribed Celexa for depression.

Surgery was for clogged coronaries not heart attack. I have always been at a healthy weight and am active in warm weather. Since taking the drug I have experienced the following: developed dry cough; diagnosed with asthma; diagnosed as non insulin dependent pre-type II diabetic; very good bp control except for one incident when dosage was increased from 50 to 100 mg / day; and finally when I went to an allergist to get help with sinus/ asthma symptoms was told allergy tests could NOT be performed because if I had a reaction to a skin test that progressed to antifalactic shock the beta blocker would Block the effect of an adrenalin shot to your heart and you cannot be saved. Therefore, my allergist can only treat my allergic symptoms and not find out what I am allergic to. What a shock to find out anyone who takes atenolol cannot be saved in they experience antifalatic shock."

I started with atenelol to regulate my heart rate, which it did. I am also glad that it is a very inexpensive drug(insurance doesn't cover it).

For a least a year now I have been very dizzy, short of breath, and weak. I have seen many doctors within the year and they haven't done anything. The other day I was trying to do my laundry and my arms felt limp and weak. My blood pressure was dropping to 75/60 and I felt the room spinning. I called the nurse and she made an appointment for me the following Monday. It turns out that I was on too much of the medicine.  Glad to be coming off of this drug."

"User Reviews & Ratings - atenolol oral","Tenormin","I have been on this medication for one year now and have had absolutely NO problems or side affects.  My cardiologist perscribed this medication for me because I had a rapid pulse with no cause.  My heart would race when I was either stressed or exerted myself.  Even walking fast would cause my pulse to race and I'd get light headed.  My resting heart rate was around 115-120!  The day I started taking atenolol, my resting heart rate slowed to the 70's and now if I exercise, my heart rate only raises to a safe level.  I take this medication right before I go to bed and I have never had any side effects whatsoever.  This medication has done wonders for me.  I have a much more improved quality of life.  And - this medication is very inexpensive - only about $4 every three months!  I have no qualms about taking this medication for as long as my cardiologist suggests."

"atenolol oral","Tenormin","I went to the hospital because I was having a hard pounding in my chest every five minutes or so. They asked me how long I had high blood pressure, and I said I didn't know I had it. They gave me the medication and said I was having heart pulputions or something like that. Well, I thought it was a panic attack for losing a $2000.00 check that I never lost. (Later found it at home)Well, they don't tell you once you start taking it that you can't just stop taking it or it can damage your heart. So, I took it for like 2 years and was experiencing soreness in my legs to where I couldn't walk and felt ill all the time, so, my doctor made me take a higher dose, and the symptoms got worse. I told her about the soreness in my muscles and she said it was from working too hard. Then she left her place of work and got her own practice but didn't take all of her patients that she was treating I guess. Anyway I went and got a three months supply and started taking 3 quarters of it for like 6 weeks then went to half for 6 weeks then to a quater for six weeks and then stopped. It's been almosts 2 years now and haven't had any problems with the muscle in my legs and check my bllod pressure regulary and it's been normal. Just wanted to sharethat little story for those who might be experiencing the same things. Get check out by a good doctor, not one who just wants the paycheck and one who care about thier patient."

I was unable to function at all three or four days a week.
The doctors where unable to determined what was causing my severe dizziness and lightheadedness.

As a last resort I found another Doctor and had him find another blood pressure medication.

It continues to rotate to different joints, but has not stopped since.  Could one or both blood pressure drugs be exacerbating my arthritis?"

"User Reviews & Ratings - atenolol oral","Tenormin","Atenolol lowered my blood pressure fairly well, but also lowered my heart rate significantly.  At one point my pulse was around 40 bpm while at rest.  It took away some of my energy as well, and I had to stop taking it.  I tried several other medications for hypertension with some success, and ended up back on Atenolol.  I now take both Atenolol and Lisinopril, and together they are working wonderfully.  I've had high blood pressure since I was 16, and Atenolol was the first medicine I was prescribed.  When I was 16, it caused too bad of side effects for me to continue.  I am now at a lower dose of Atenolol and a fairly low dose of Lisinopril, and together they have lowered my blood pressure without any bad side effects."

"User Reviews & Ratings - atenolol oral","Tenormin","I was prescribed Atenolol (25mg)after experiencing a sudden onset of palpitation, which I've never had in my life! I was rushed to ER and was later diagnosed as having SupreVentricular Tachycardia (SVT),and was admitted for overnight observation. The treadmill stress test, echocardiogram, EKG, blood tests were all normal. The Atenolol (25mg)did not stop my palpitations. In fact, I had a total of 10 episodes that was captured while wearing the ""King Of Hearts"" monitor. So, my cardiologist increased the dosage to 50mg. I was then referred to another specialist; a cardio physiologist who specializes in heart rhythm and I was given two options: life of medications or catheter ablation. I chose the latter in January 2009, but my heart would not palpate even with three different induced palpitations drugs. Although, it was unsuccessful, the good thing is that the cardiologist did verify that my heart is healthy--disease free. I was put on Flecaininde (100mg)twice daily; once in the morning, and again in the evening. All was well until most recently when I started experiencing very cold hands and feet, lightheadedness having dizzy spells when I stood up. But, what concerned me was my low heart rate and blood pressure. So, I was told to stop the Atenolol for two days, which I did. However, the second day my heart went into palpitations that lasted for about 25 minutes. I had my neighbor rush me to ER and my BP was reading at 189/90 plus, but heart rate was within the norm (89). Everytime, I have this episode, it cannot be duplicated at the ER, which is crazy. In addition, I completely stopped taking Gemfibrozil, Simvastatin, and Lovaza because of it tore up my gut, caused severe burning pain in my lower back that eventually traversed into my chest area. I discovered that I cannot take Omega-3 fish oil whether liquid or tablets, as it caused me to have gas pockets in my throat; a feeling of food stuck in my throat, which sent me to ER also. I hate taking drugs!"

"amlodipine oral","Norvasc","not only did it not reduce my BP significantly but it produced a violent allergic facial skin condition ,first itching and red rash ,then hives [lumps ] and finally swelling all over my face resulting in a visit to A & E 
and 4 weeks on steroids and many weeks of misery .
There is a reference to this side effect being ""very rare""
but I wonder how rare it really is --manufacturers rely 
on patients to report side effects , but when they are as extreme as this many people would wish to have nothing 
more to do with the drug  or its maker -that is my reaction . The main problem with an allergic reaction of this sort is that it it is not immediately apparent what is causing it  ,particularly if you are taking other drugs . Also there are many other substances that can cause allergic 
reactions and even a consultant dermatologist may not look at a mainstream drug as an obvious candidate when
there be any number of environmental or food factors 
involved .Only by a long and exhaustive elimination process was amlodipine identified as the villain in my 
case --stopping taking it while continuing the steroids 
cured it completely ,but as soon as I started again [still taking the steroids ] back it came and the steroids could do nothing to stop it . I think more research needs to be done on this --the swelling and hives if they progress inwards around the face can lead to serious complications."

Three days after switching back to the drug, Diovan (which gives me leg cramps) the vertigo is gone and the dizziness has almost subsided."

"amlodipine oral","Norvasc","After repeated bp systolic readings over 200, I was started on this med in December 2013, and am still on it. I have also been on 2 other classes of blood pressure meds for years. All bp meds are at maximum dosage at present. I also have had a diagnosis of chronic pain syndrome with associated osteoarthritis in numerous locations AND fibromyalgia; that was diagnoses in 2000. As of now, my systolic bp is still high with frequent readings in the 170's.

What I specifically want to address is that the side effects of this medication has had a devastating effect on my carefully balanced pain management.   The swelling of the hands and feet has brought on almost constant pain in my wrists and hands.  Sleep is always an issue with fibromyalgia, and this drug only adds to those issues; I also certainly did not need help with my depression.  I am so tired and in so much pain.  After appointments with my family practitioner and my rheumatologist this week, they are working together to on how to satisfactorily manage both my bp and my pain level.  I think this drug needs some careful study on its interactions in patients diagnosed with chronic pain syndrome.

Must admit it is working.

Other factors must be considered as other meds. taken, B.P. II med. Lamotrigine was cut in half last 2 weeks also.

Stress factors also need to be considered.  Must find way to reduce them (yoga, tai-che, mediation, diet, exercise)

Still have occasional tightness of chest at times.  Must take deep breaths for a minute or two, then I'm okay.

No real side affects noticed except very foul urine stench, and being 'bound"" up.

I've forced myself to drink more fluids to flush the med. and found 1 to 2 cups of hot tea, 2000mg vit C, 1000mg vit. E further helped to reduce ""foul"" urine stench.  Added more dark leafy veg's. to keep looser.

After reading this post, I know it is the meds--because I was taking acai berry before medication with no problems.  Anyway, I will refrain from both.  I have tried two other medications--experienced uncomfortable side effects.  Oh yeah, also have weight gain and stomach bloating.  I hope to find a natural alternative.  I do walk daily and used to run also.  High blood pressure diagnosed shortly after my father's death.  seem to have increased when I am stressed. "

"amlodipine oral","Norvasc","Started 1 month ago on 10mg Amlodipine, 10 mg Lisinopril, and 25mg hydrochlorothiazide daily for scary high BP. My pressure came down quickly BUT the side effects have been troublesome. Fatigue (especially in the afternoon), weakness, dizziness, hair loss (about 3 times the normal amount of hair in my shower-yikes!), loss of appetite, weirdly cold fingers at times, slight ankle swelling, and low blood pressure. I almost blacked out while driving when I took a deep breath and held it to get rid of a bout of hiccups!
 
I have recently scaled back on my dosages to 5mg of each BP medication daily and my blood pressure so far has been fine with the lower doses. My side effects are much less with the lower doses and I am feeling almost normal. 
I am taking 1200mg garlic daily since I have read it can help lower blood pressure. I am wearing compression stockings during the day to help keep ankle swelling down. I have lost almost 10 lbs since beginning treatment for my BP, I suspect because the meds have killed my appetite. 

My goal is through weight and diet management to be able to get off the medications completely. I'm still about 20 lbs too heavy so I'm working to lose the extra lbs. Hopefully that will normalize my BP and allow me to be medication free. Wish me luck!  "

After 3 weeks the angina has now virtually disappeared. Even with much increased low level excercise.

Major side effect - Very tired, all the time, every day.  
Sometimes minor - dizziness, nausea, head pain, stiff muscles, weight gain.  One irregular heart beat. "
"User Reviews & Ratings - amlodipine oral","Norvasc","Family doctor started Tenorectic and then added Amlodipine, both for high blood pressure.   Dosages were at the lowest level.   After Amlodipine was added, the side effects included a boiling soup sound and sensation in my stomach, alternating constipation and diarrhea, tarry stools, stinging, burning and pain going to the bathroom, weird sensation in mouth in morning, hot flashes and sweats, flushing, irregular heartbeat, etc. 
After enduring the side effects for too long,  a cardiologist eliminated the Amlodipine. The side effects were gone within days, except for the stinging and burning going to the bathroom.  Six months after the Amlodipine was stopped,  an endoscopy showed a healing ulcer in my stomach.  The periodontist  may need to surgically fix the receding gums.   A  colonoscopy was clean.  As of this date, the burning sensation, abdominal pain and the tarry stools, have not occurred since the colonoscopy.

My doctor told me not to worry, its a side effect. After being in this drug for 6 mos. I never felt good and sometimes had palpitations after taking it.

I've also gained at least 25 pounds since I started taking this pill and I bruise extremely easily. My arms hurt so badly I asked my husband to massage them and now I look like I've been beaten! The FDA must re-evaluate this medication because of the excessive amount of side effects. I'd rather have the high blood pressure than the terrible side-effects of this pill. "

Tough to get a good nights rest. My sex drive is almost zero. (yes there is sex after sixty :) Oh, and my ears itch. Strange, but true. My blood pressure is still good (115-120 over 75) But I know I have gained at least 10-15 lbs of water weight.

"amlodipine oral","Norvasc","I took this medicine for High BP, while it has lowered my BP, it hasn't lowered it enough. In addition I am experiancing extreme leg and muscle pain. While easy to use, it's one of those meds you can't just stop taking when you don't like it, you have to be weened off, I'm not comfortable with that. I have found several natural remedies that I will be switching to as soon as my doctor gets me off this crap. "
"User Reviews & Ratings - amlodipine oral","Norvasc","I switched from Lisinopril 20 mg. to 2.5 mg of Amlodipine. Blood pressure stays around 110/78. Also taking HCTZ, so no swelling noticed in legs & feet, although I am gaining weight. I got very ill after drinking a daily ounce of pomegranate juice with my medication: severely low BP (at lowest point, 79/58), dizziness and shortness of breath.  I drank pom juice with meds for 3 days and the effect has been like an overdose. DO NOT DRINK POMEGRANATE JUICE WITH AMLODIPINE!  It is like grapefruit juice and can be toxic!   It has been 6 days since I have been off my meds and my BP is staying low (109/77) and still dizzy.  I can't walk for long periods of time and have to stop for a few minutes to catch my breath and control the dizziness.  Hoping that the effects will dissipate soon and I can get back to normal.  I am drinking cranberry juice to help detox my liver and kidneys.  It seems to be helping, but I had like 15 days worth of meds in my body.  "

No real pain/itching/rashes to mention, I do have dry mouth & urinate a couple times a night (but this was occurring before the med), no erection or sexual performance problems either."

The doctor put me on this today and after reading reviews decided not to take it. The thing is that I went to the doctor for a rash on my leg and they never even adressed that now they have me taking all kinds of tests and taking meds for high blood pressure. How do they know I have high blood pressure if it was the first time they have taken my pressure. You cant make that judgement by one time. Time to find a new doctor. By the sounds of things I think the doctors are getting a kickback for prescribing this med. Well they are not getting my $$$."
"amlodipine oral","Norvasc","I have been on this medication for some time in addition to taking Diovan HCT 320/12.5 which is a combination blood pressure and water pill. I would take the Amlodipine 10mg in the evening and the other in the AM hours. I too had attributed my aches and pains etc. to getting older, however after reading all 274 Reviews I believe this medication is responsible for most of my problems.. No sex drive, weight gain, crazy dreams that make no sense at all, swollen feet/ankles and legs, feeling that my throat was narrowing, making it noticable to swallow, dry itchy skin, pain in my left shoulder and neck, getting up 2-3 times during the night to tinkle,inability to get to sleep or sleeping for 4-6 hrs a night,thinning hair, dry eyes and mouth, heart palpations which caused my cardiologist to feel that I needed a pacemaker, which I have had now for one year.(Wonder if I really needed that). Since I didn't have any of these problems before,.. like I said I attributed it to aging. What brought this medication to my attention?.. I ran out and needed a new prescription, using a military mail order firm, new scripts take 10-14 days to fill... after about 5 days without it I noticed that I had dropped 1 1/2 lbs and now a week later I have lost 7 lbs.. I had gained about 40 lbs over the past 5 years and was miserable, tried exercising, diet etc.with no results or non lasting weight loss.I received my refill yesterday and I think that I am not going to take it and see just what happens. The pain in my shoulder is easing up, no more hip and back pain, (I have had both hip joint replaced, but the muscles around them hurt),the night sweats in the neck/upper chest area have diminished, my dreams have some sequence,no pain in my legs, still waiting for the libido to come back(yes there is sex after 70:-), Still get up during the night to tinkle.. hopefully that will ease up too. I'll keep you guys posted.I hope everything gets better for everyone.

"amlodipine oral","Norvasc","Note to ""Not Feeling Well:""
My advice is get a new Dr. before this one kills you with over medication! Lisinopril is the culprit for your coughing as told to me by a pharmacist. Please, for your own good, get a second opinion. 
After coughing my head off due to Lisinopril I changed to Amlopidine 5mg. two years ago. Fortunately, no side effects and bp in normal range most of the time. I research all drugs that my new doctor prescribes and so far most of them have too many side effects to even consider taking them. It's still my body and ultimately, I'm the only one responsible for its condition. 
Why do drug salesmen give free samples to doctors? Think about it.

OK, back to Amlodipine: It does lower your bp but in my case with several side efects such as Lightheadedness, swollen ankles low libido and very poor tolerance for alcohol, those still persist, however some of the initial side efects such as insomnia, constipation and skin rashes were gone after the first week of use.

Dr. does NOT think ankle swelling is from the drug and I beg to differ because never have I had swelling in the enkles - just seems likely that when a person starts taking a different drug and experience symptoms not evident previously - then DAH!

He didn't ask what was going on in his life or how he was feeling he just wrote the script and walked out.  My husband's demeanor changed for the worse, his libido is nil.  He sweats profusely and has gained 40 lbs in these 2 years and has added stomach problems to his laundry list of symptoms.  Istead of taking the meds away they add more.  His BP has been normal since he started taking the pills, it just goes up when he stresses out about having to go to the dr.  His legs are going bad and he has sciatica.

"ramipril oral","Altace","I am a 62 year-old male who underwent quadruple bypass surgery in 2008. I began this medicine as part of my BP regimen, as a way of reducing my dosage of Bystolic (a Beta blocker), with which I was having a very bad outcome (I also take Amlodipine and Dyazide.  I started at 2.5 mg, but after three months went to 5 mg.  The side effects have gotten progressively worse:  tiredness (as with all BP meds), dizziness, occasional nausea and abominable pain, deep fissures on my tongue--even toothpaste and mouthwash burn, worsening constipation and bloating, and most troublesome, unpredictable anxiety (nervous)attacks.  The only effective way of diffusing these attacks has been Xanax.  As far as I am concerned, this is a terrible drug.  On my own, I have reduced my dosage by half (back to one 2.5 mg. capsule a day), and will be seeing my doctor in the next few days to see what my alternatives might be.  Another major frustration:  there are a number of contraindications and drug interaction warnings, some fairly serious, concerning which neither my cardiologist, PCP, or pharmacists have counseled me.  From the statistics, it appears I am in a minority, but for those of us who are highly sensitive to medications, Ramipril is sheer misery."

There were times when I thought the capsules didn't have anything in them because my blood pressure would jump to very high, like 175/96.  Even on Ramipril my BP is doing the same, fluctuating.  My biggest problem is getting my stress lowered.  I also take Amlodipine, Atenolol, and Synthroid.  I've actually had very few side effects with Ramipril.  Amlodipine is extra BP med if my BP gets too high.  I do have problems with my memory at times and I'm tired most of the time.  I'm now taking B12 shots once a month.  I think we all need to get our vitamin levels checked at least once a year.  My vitamin D levels were very low and I had to take shots for that.  I've not had coughing problems but keep a sore throat.  I do get vertigo every once in a while.  I keep meclizine with me all the time.  Weight and lack of exercise play a key role in stress and tiredness.  I'm working on this.  I do not have any insurance right now and the cost of Ramipril is very high.

"ramipril oral","Altace","This drug is extremelly efficient in reduce BP, however, in my case did not last even for 6 h (higher and lower concenrations, 1.5 to 20mg). This mean after i used a clear and strong drop in BP was observed. but this drop was not maintaned for more that 6 h even a higher concentrations. This result in extremelly low BP after taking the capsule and then start going up. Up and down is not good for experience. Then i star mixing low doses of ralipril with nifedipine and is working great, even that i am not taking ramirpil anymore and was replaced totally with nifedipine. Now my BP is 100 to 110 over 70 to 80. Good drug but not lasting enough. The main side effect was extremelly fast reduction in BP (too low) and then a fat recovery. A nice point of this drugs is the multiple concentrations that you can try and ajust your own concentration. Even some times you can take a small amount before a huge barbecue (a lot of salt) to control the sibsequent unbalances. I hope that help and feel better

Onto Carvedilol 6.25. Didn't like this at all, caused what I call ""scalp pain"". Came to find out, this is caused by blood pressure droping. Carvedilol also caused my blood sugar drop.

"User Reviews & Ratings - enalapril maleate oral","Vasotec","After taking Enalapril 20 mg once a day for about three years after being switched from another Ace inhibior, due to the dry non-productive cough, my doctor increased my doage to one 20 mg. twice a day.  About two to three months later I began to experience 
terrible flatulence, but worse of all I had
a change in my bowels and consequently changed my diet to include more fiber without over doing it.  The situation got 
increasingly worse and I was not getting any
help from my primary care physician who suggested with scare tactics that I needed to eliminated the possibility of cancer, which OF COURSE I did almost immediately.
On two separate occasions-one before the 
colonoscopy and one post, I stopped taking
the Enalapril, then the anti-inflammatory
(prescribed after the colonoscopy).  On both
occasions there was a marked difference.  The second time I remained off Enalapril and all the mucosa and fecal incontinence
disappeared until I started another medication in the ARB category.  Needless to say I did not take it for too long; maybe six weeks before my bowels began to go for five to six days with no movement.
Prior to the original malfunction mani-
festation, my bowels would always move 
thoroughly at least every other day, and
sometimes two to three times a day.  I would NEVER go five days without a movement.  Now, as a I am writing about it in hope of helping another poor soul, I see why so many adult diapers are on the market.  Dr. William Prather wrote the article on a study of Enalapril at Harvard
Medical School that gave me the courage to
quit the blood pressure medication, but my
blood pressure is far, far from normal EVERY DAY. And I have to say that I feel 
better that I can eliminate normally, but I know my blood pressure needs down from 170/90.  Is there any hope for me knowing 
that I can not tolerate Ace Inhibitors or
ARB's.  Please Help Me (before I suffer too much damage)  BJW  "

"valsartan oral","Diovan","My doctor switched me from Lisinopril to Valsartan because of continuing orthostatic events (faintness on standing but no fainting). Took Valsartan for 14 months before taking myself off the drug.

Orthostatic events continued on valsartan and worsened. I considered wearing a helmet!

Two or three months after beginning Valsartan I began experiencing ""many"" ectopic beats, PAC's and PVC's. I'd never before experienced PVC's but did not associate with Valsartan - thought I'd strained something exercising. A Polar exercise heart monitor at one point indicated 18.5% ectopic beats immediately after a night's sleep. 

Within 3 days of stopping Valsartan, the ectopic beats essentially disappeared. At two months after stopping Valsartan, I can't detect PAC's or PVC's. 

Over the last 18 months I've been exercising and lost about 50 lbs - my blood pressure has remained low, typically 100/65. The orthostatic events are getting rare, a few days between events now. On Valsartan(and Lisinopril), if I sat in a chair more than 15 minutes, I planned on being faint after standing.

After two months free of Valsartan, I'm beginning to think the drug was about to kill me. I am, perhaps incorrectly, viewing the arrhythmias as a ticket to sudden heart failure.

I don't recommend that anyone stop the drug without consulting their doctor. My doctor didn't seem concerned about what I was experiencing but I perceived severe quality of life issues. I was NOT suicidal. I monitored BP closely and figured I could start taking the drug again if BP rose excessively; it did not."

"User Reviews & Ratings - atenolol oral","Tenormin","The effectiveness of many medications is such a trade off between the obvious effect (the good thing) and the side effects or negative stuff, which can be many. The cold hands and feet in the beginning of treatment with atenolol or tenormin as I new it 30 years ago tells us what? That something is just not completely correct here but your body is amazing and it adjusts, your body can adjust to many things that might not be totally good for you. I am not belittling atenolol because I believe the overall good for me as far as blood pressure is concerned  is a good thing. I do believe that it has contributed to ED and fatigue, but whats the trade off? again...Life is never perfect and my wife who has heart issues and POTS and other things has been prescribed medicine time and time again but ends up never taking anything. My take on it is she skips the effects and goes right to the side effects. Its quite a phenomena. For me I would like to try a new blood pressure medicine but after so much time, don't know if its worth it. Although.....I believe that sex and love and the ability to perform is life and without it, well, it has a psychological effect on you.. In the end a beta blocker and an aspirin will probably save my life one day only to linger on for another day... HaH! I am being melodramatic, what can I say , I guess thats just me.....:)"

"atenolol oral","Tenormin","I took this medication for about 8 months to help control my problems with Tachycardia. It helped as far as keeping my blood pressure and heart rate down, but not long after taking it I started having some major problems with Acid Reflux. I also had severe Esophageal Spasms almost the entire time I was taking this medicine, and thought it was heart related. It felt like a painful fluttering in the left side of my chest. The whole time I was on this medicine I went between my PCP, an ENT Specialist with Reflux problems, as well as a trip to the ER when the Esophageal Spasms got very bad one night and I thought I was having a heart attack. The ER actually increased my dosage of Atenolol! None of the doctors I saw ever realized the problem I was having was a side effect of Atenolol. I finally stopped taking this medicine on my own after doing a lot of research and reading that the problems I was having with Reflux ""could be"" a side effect of it. A few weeks after being off of it my Reflux started to improve and the Esophageal Spasms went away entirely. I know this medicine was the cause, because a week ago my heart started racing again and my BP was elevated, so I gave in and tried to go back on the Atenolol. After only 2 doses I had painful Esophageal Spasms again. I will be scheduling a follow up with my doctor ASAP to see what else I might try to take in place of the Atenolol. "

I sought a second opinion, thank God, who said my heart beats were not that bad to require this medication, so he weaned me off of it.I took  1 25 mg tab for a weeks, then 1/2 a tab for a week, then 1/2 tab every other day for a week.  I feel so much better now.My first cardiologist said that if I stopped taking this medication, I would end up in the ER with a heart attack.  My second cardiologist said that was nonsense, and told me to get off the drug if I wanted to.  I did.  I HATE this drug and think that it should be taken off the market.  It made my life a living hell for no reason.  My first cardiologist did not believe me.  All I can say is if you have similar side effects, GET A SECOND OPINION! The funny thing is, I think that this medication gave me anxiety and made my irregular heart beats worse.  I am an attorney, and don't like to be treated like an idiot by a doctor(my first cardiologist)  It's been 2 weeks since I totally went off this drug.  No dizziness or nausea.

He agreed, and I immediately felt SO much better, now a year later, my BP is perfect, and i have no more dizzy spells and weakness.  A lot of people are ""allergic"" to this drug.

I told her about the soreness in my muscles and she said it was from working too hard. Then she left her place of work and got her own practice but didn't take all of her patients that she was treating I guess.

It did a very good job at lowering my blood pressure.
After taking Atenolol (10mg) daily for approximately three years the side affects started.
I was unable to function at all three or four days a week.
The doctors where unable to determined what was causing my severe dizziness and lightheadedness.
This was after numerous X-Rays, Cat Scans and MRIs
After almost two years of suffering, I decided to quit all of my Vitamins and supplemental; I take about twenty a day.
As a last resort I found another Doctor and had him find another blood pressure medication.
Im now taking Amlodipine (10mg) daily.
It seems to be working somewhat, my BP is still much high.
After coming off the Atenolol over a thirty day period about 80% of the side affects are gone, thank the Lord for small favors.
Be very careful with all of the so called FDA approved blood pressure drugs.
I only wish a few more Medical Doctors would read some of reviews that real people write.

"atenolol oral","Tenormin","I was prescribed Atenolol (25mg)after experiencing a sudden onset of palpitation, which I've never had in my life! I was rushed to ER and was later diagnosed as having SupreVentricular Tachycardia (SVT),and was admitted for overnight observation. The treadmill stress test, echocardiogram, EKG, blood tests were all normal. The Atenolol (25mg)did not stop my palpitations. In fact, I had a total of 10 episodes that was captured while wearing the ""King Of Hearts"" monitor. So, my cardiologist increased the dosage to 50mg. I was then referred to another specialist; a cardio physiologist who specializes in heart rhythm and I was given two options: life of medications or catheter ablation. I chose the latter in January 2009, but my heart would not palpate even with three different induced palpitations drugs. Although, it was unsuccessful, the good thing is that the cardiologist did verify that my heart is healthy--disease free. I was put on Flecaininde (100mg)twice daily; once in the morning, and again in the evening. All was well until most recently when I started experiencing very cold hands and feet, lightheadedness having dizzy spells when I stood up. But, what concerned me was my low heart rate and blood pressure. So, I was told to stop the Atenolol for two days, which I did. However, the second day my heart went into palpitations that lasted for about 25 minutes. I had my neighbor rush me to ER and my BP was reading at 189/90 plus, but heart rate was within the norm (89). Everytime, I have this episode, it cannot be duplicated at the ER, which is crazy. In addition, I completely stopped taking Gemfibrozil, Simvastatin, and Lovaza because of it tore up my gut, caused severe burning pain in my lower back that eventually traversed into my chest area. I discovered that I cannot take Omega-3 fish oil whether liquid or tablets, as it caused me to have gas pockets in my throat; a feeling of food stuck in my throat, which sent me to ER also. I hate taking drugs!"

"User Reviews & Ratings - atenolol oral","Tenormin","I was diagnosed in July 2007 with a rare anamalous coronary artery. My cardiologist had never seen one quite like mine.  My LAD artery originates on the wrong side of my heart and passes between 2 large arteries on top.  The only way to fix this is bypass surgery.  I am 51 years old and have been active in sports, etc. all of my life, but had been having slight tightness in my chest.  Due to a family history of heart disease, I decided to get checked out.  After all the necessary tests (heart cath, etc) he put me on 50 mg of atenolol to relax my heart and hopefully keep the stray artery from getting compressed.  My blood pressure is good, and pulse runs in the 50s when resting, sometimes in the high 40s. I do feel tired sometimes and have cold hands.  I have also experienced some sexual dysfunction, but not severe - everything still works. Overall, I am active and doing great.  The slight side effects I have are better than surgery!  I hope the atenolol continues to work for me.  I also take 10 mg of lipitor and lovaza (omega 3) for triglycerides.  "

and 4 weeks on steroids and many weeks of misery .
There is a reference to this side effect being ""very rare""
but I wonder how rare it really is --manufacturers rely 
on patients to report side effects , but when they are as extreme as this many people would wish to have nothing 
more to do with the drug  or its maker -that is my reaction . The main problem with an allergic reaction of this sort is that it it is not immediately apparent what is causing it  ,particularly if you are taking other drugs . Also there are many other substances that can cause allergic 
reactions and even a consultant dermatologist may not look at a mainstream drug as an obvious candidate when
there be any number of environmental or food factors 
involved .Only by a long and exhaustive elimination process was amlodipine identified as the villain in my 
case --stopping taking it while continuing the steroids 
cured it completely ,but as soon as I started again [still taking the steroids ] back it came and the steroids could do nothing to stop it . I think more research needs to be done on this --the swelling and hives if they progress inwards around the face can lead to serious complications."

"User Reviews & Ratings - amlodipine oral","Norvasc","After repeated bp systolic readings over 200, I was started on this med in December 2013, and am still on it. I have also been on 2 other classes of blood pressure meds for years. All bp meds are at maximum dosage at present. I also have had a diagnosis of chronic pain syndrome with associated osteoarthritis in numerous locations AND fibromyalgia; that was diagnoses in 2000. As of now, my systolic bp is still high with frequent readings in the 170's.

What I specifically want to address is that the side effects of this medication has had a devastating effect on my carefully balanced pain management.   The swelling of the hands and feet has brought on almost constant pain in my wrists and hands.  Sleep is always an issue with fibromyalgia, and this drug only adds to those issues; I also certainly did not need help with my depression.  I am so tired and in so much pain.  After appointments with my family practitioner and my rheumatologist this week, they are working together to on how to satisfactorily manage both my bp and my pain level.  I think this drug needs some careful study on its interactions in patients diagnosed with chronic pain syndrome.

Still have occasional tightness of chest at times.  Must take deep breaths for a minute or two, then I'm okay.

No real side affects noticed except very foul urine stench, and being 'bound"" up.

I've forced myself to drink more fluids to flush the med. and found 1 to 2 cups of hot tea, 2000mg vit C, 1000mg vit. E further helped to reduce ""foul"" urine stench.  Added more dark leafy veg's. to keep looser.

Have been so sick with  a number these side effects, I trully felt like I had got some type disease after 2 mo on this drug.

"amlodipine oral","Norvasc","since starting this medicine i started to have problems with breathing and shortnest of breath"
"amlodipine oral","Norvasc","Started 1 month ago on 10mg Amlodipine, 10 mg Lisinopril, and 25mg hydrochlorothiazide daily for scary high BP. My pressure came down quickly BUT the side effects have been troublesome. Fatigue (especially in the afternoon), weakness, dizziness, hair loss (about 3 times the normal amount of hair in my shower-yikes!), loss of appetite, weirdly cold fingers at times, slight ankle swelling, and low blood pressure. I almost blacked out while driving when I took a deep breath and held it to get rid of a bout of hiccups!
 
I have recently scaled back on my dosages to 5mg of each BP medication daily and my blood pressure so far has been fine with the lower doses. My side effects are much less with the lower doses and I am feeling almost normal. 
I am taking 1200mg garlic daily since I have read it can help lower blood pressure. I am wearing compression stockings during the day to help keep ankle swelling down. I have lost almost 10 lbs since beginning treatment for my BP, I suspect because the meds have killed my appetite. 

My goal is through weight and diet management to be able to get off the medications completely. I'm still about 20 lbs too heavy so I'm working to lose the extra lbs. Hopefully that will normalize my BP and allow me to be medication free. Wish me luck!  "

Six months after the Amlodipine was stopped,  an endoscopy showed a healing ulcer in my stomach.  The periodontist  may need to surgically fix the receding gums.   A  colonoscopy was clean.

How do they know I have high blood pressure if it was the first time they have taken my pressure. You cant make that judgement by one time. Time to find a new doctor. By the sounds of things I think the doctors are getting a kickback for prescribing this med. Well they are not getting my $$$."
"amlodipine oral","Norvasc","I have been on this medication for some time in addition to taking Diovan HCT 320/12.5 which is a combination blood pressure and water pill. I would take the Amlodipine 10mg in the evening and the other in the AM hours. I too had attributed my aches and pains etc. to getting older, however after reading all 274 Reviews I believe this medication is responsible for most of my problems.. No sex drive, weight gain, crazy dreams that make no sense at all, swollen feet/ankles and legs, feeling that my throat was narrowing, making it noticable to swallow, dry itchy skin, pain in my left shoulder and neck, getting up 2-3 times during the night to tinkle,inability to get to sleep or sleeping for 4-6 hrs a night,thinning hair, dry eyes and mouth, heart palpations which caused my cardiologist to feel that I needed a pacemaker, which I have had now for one year.(Wonder if I really needed that). Since I didn't have any of these problems before,.. like I said I attributed it to aging. What brought this medication to my attention?.. I ran out and needed a new prescription, using a military mail order firm, new scripts take 10-14 days to fill... after about 5 days without it I noticed that I had dropped 1 1/2 lbs and now a week later I have lost 7 lbs.. I had gained about 40 lbs over the past 5 years and was miserable, tried exercising, diet etc.with no results or non lasting weight loss.I received my refill yesterday and I think that I am not going to take it and see just what happens. The pain in my shoulder is easing up, no more hip and back pain, (I have had both hip joint replaced, but the muscles around them hurt),the night sweats in the neck/upper chest area have diminished, my dreams have some sequence,no pain in my legs, still waiting for the libido to come back(yes there is sex after 70:-), Still get up during the night to tinkle.. hopefully that will ease up too. I'll keep you guys posted.I hope everything gets better for everyone.

"User Reviews & Ratings - amlodipine oral","Norvasc","Note to ""Not Feeling Well:""
My advice is get a new Dr. before this one kills you with over medication! Lisinopril is the culprit for your coughing as told to me by a pharmacist. Please, for your own good, get a second opinion. 
After coughing my head off due to Lisinopril I changed to Amlopidine 5mg. two years ago. Fortunately, no side effects and bp in normal range most of the time. I research all drugs that my new doctor prescribes and so far most of them have too many side effects to even consider taking them. It's still my body and ultimately, I'm the only one responsible for its condition. 
Why do drug salesmen give free samples to doctors? Think about it.

"amlodipine oral","Norvasc","Started with 5mg, moved up to 10mg after a month or so, total treatment duration aprox. 3 month. Taken with a mild diuretic for the lenght of the treatment. Presently changed to a new medication within the group of ACE inhibitors called Benazepril at 20mgs plus the same diuretic. OK, back to Amlodipine: It does lower your bp but in my case with several side efects such as Lightheadedness, swollen ankles low libido and very poor tolerance for alcohol, those still persist, however some of the initial side efects such as insomnia, constipation and skin rashes were gone after the first week of use. Overall and effective med. to lower your blood pressure. Bottom line: I'm happier with Benazepril 20mgs with less side effects and a remarkable drop in blood pressure not even close to what I was able to achieve with Amlodipine."

Sometime even higher, especially during the day when the stress level (from work) is at its highest.  I will stay on it for a little bit longer to see if it actually works for me or I need a higher strength.  One thing I did see improvement is the side effects of hives.  I do not get the hives as frequent or as serveve, but it still exist.  (I have a full panel of blood tests for allegies, but ruled out all of them).   Other side effects are the same as Sular, such as dizziness, headache, lack of concentration at work, tired, having hard time falling to sleep, sudden fast heart beats, etc.  Overall, I did not find it to be very effective."

The cardiologist decided to add this drug to the current Benicar Hct 40/25mg that I was taking once daily for a year to lower my BP some more. The first thing I noticed were the side effects listed for this drug: fatigue, lack of motivation, dizzyness and mental fog, and constipation. It does lower my BP, but I feel way too laid back to be productive at all. Last week an unusual tenderness and fluid buildup appeared on my left forearm. The next day it moved to my elbow and has caused my elbow to be tender and swollen.
I will be calling the cardiologist to get off of the Amlodipine.

"amlodipine oral","Norvasc","Dr. switched me off of benezepril to avoid incipient kidney problems (no technical explanation) to amlodipine 5 mg.  Daily, usually take at around midnight before sleep. My BP is lowered, and I have far fewer side effects than with previous meds but do have irregular sleep, mild nausea, some weakness in legs, and mild constipation on an irregular basis. This round of medication is the first in my life (age 71) and I don't know enough about side effects to worry over these symptoms.  Went 4 days and nights during travel without the meds (forgot to pack 'em) and felt great the whole trip.  Got back, resumed once daily intake, now have leg weakness, stomach upset, irregular sleep, and heavy eye mattering again.  None of those is fatal I guess, but there is discomfort when using amlodipine. I'm hoping to be off all meds altogether after a year's use of BP med, and first time ever watching dietary content.  It's disturbing and not in my lifestyle pattern to take anything."

"User Reviews & Ratings - ramipril oral","Altace","This drug should be removed from the market.  It causes nothing but harm.  I had a very bad coughs for five months during the period of taking this DAMNED drug without realizing it.  It's damaged my lung and my respiratory system, inflamation in the throat.  I was shivering in the early morning between 4 and 5 o'clock while I was sleeping, and coughed ""my lung's out!"".  I gasped for air whenever I was on the airplane, train, or the environment that's stuffy, and coughed till about to throw up.  I felt like I was choking to death.

I am regret that I've taken this drug.  I wonder who's manufactured this product, it causes more harm than good.   It should be removed from the market before it causes serious damage to a human body.  For God's sake, I have a high blood pressure, not a LUNG CANCER!!! Has the NDC been aware of the damage of this drug cause to the lung and the respiratory system.  Could somebody please do something about it before major law suits and before human life is wasted away.  Thanks."

"ramipril oral","Altace","I am a 62 year-old male who underwent quadruple bypass surgery in 2008. I began this medicine as part of my BP regimen, as a way of reducing my dosage of Bystolic (a Beta blocker), with which I was having a very bad outcome (I also take Amlodipine and Dyazide.  I started at 2.5 mg, but after three months went to 5 mg.  The side effects have gotten progressively worse:  tiredness (as with all BP meds), dizziness, occasional nausea and abominable pain, deep fissures on my tongue--even toothpaste and mouthwash burn, worsening constipation and bloating, and most troublesome, unpredictable anxiety (nervous)attacks.  The only effective way of diffusing these attacks has been Xanax.  As far as I am concerned, this is a terrible drug.  On my own, I have reduced my dosage by half (back to one 2.5 mg. capsule a day), and will be seeing my doctor in the next few days to see what my alternatives might be.  Another major frustration:  there are a number of contraindications and drug interaction warnings, some fairly serious, concerning which neither my cardiologist, PCP, or pharmacists have counseled me.  From the statistics, it appears I am in a minority, but for those of us who are highly sensitive to medications, Ramipril is sheer misery."

"ramipril oral","Altace","I started taking Altace in the 90's then a few months ago when the generic came out I started taking it.  There were times when I thought the capsules didn't have anything in them because my blood pressure would jump to very high, like 175/96.  Even on Ramipril my BP is doing the same, fluctuating.  My biggest problem is getting my stress lowered.  I also take Amlodipine, Atenolol, and Synthroid.  I've actually had very few side effects with Ramipril.  Amlodipine is extra BP med if my BP gets too high.  I do have problems with my memory at times and I'm tired most of the time.  I'm now taking B12 shots once a month.  I think we all need to get our vitamin levels checked at least once a year.  My vitamin D levels were very low and I had to take shots for that.  I've not had coughing problems but keep a sore throat.  I do get vertigo every once in a while.  I keep meclizine with me all the time.  Weight and lack of exercise play a key role in stress and tiredness.  I'm working on this.  I do not have any insurance right now and the cost of Ramipril is very high.

"ramipril oral","Altace","This drug is extremelly efficient in reduce BP, however, in my case did not last even for 6 h (higher and lower concenrations, 1.5 to 20mg). This mean after i used a clear and strong drop in BP was observed. but this drop was not maintaned for more that 6 h even a higher concentrations. This result in extremelly low BP after taking the capsule and then start going up. Up and down is not good for experience. Then i star mixing low doses of ralipril with nifedipine and is working great, even that i am not taking ramirpil anymore and was replaced totally with nifedipine. Now my BP is 100 to 110 over 70 to 80. Good drug but not lasting enough. The main side effect was extremelly fast reduction in BP (too low) and then a fat recovery. A nice point of this drugs is the multiple concentrations that you can try and ajust your own concentration. Even some times you can take a small amount before a huge barbecue (a lot of salt) to control the sibsequent unbalances. I hope that help and feel better

About two to three months later I began to experience 
terrible flatulence, but worse of all I had
a change in my bowels and consequently changed my diet to include more fiber without over doing it.  The situation got 
increasingly worse and I was not getting any

On two separate occasions-one before the 
colonoscopy and one post, I stopped taking
the Enalapril, then the anti-inflammatory
(prescribed after the colonoscopy).  On both
occasions there was a marked difference.  The second time I remained off Enalapril and all the mucosa and fecal incontinence
disappeared until I started another medication in the ARB category.  Needless to say I did not take it for too long; maybe six weeks before my bowels began to go for five to six days with no movement.
Prior to the original malfunction mani-
festation, my bowels would always move 
thoroughly at least every other day, and
sometimes two to three times a day.  I would NEVER go five days without a movement.  Now, as a I am writing about it in hope of helping another poor soul, I see why so many adult diapers are on the market.  Dr. William Prather wrote the article on a study of Enalapril at Harvard
Medical School that gave me the courage to
quit the blood pressure medication, but my
blood pressure is far, far from normal EVERY DAY. And I have to say that I feel 
better that I can eliminate normally, but I know my blood pressure needs down from 170/90.  Is there any hope for me knowing

ARB's.  Please Help Me (before I suffer too much damage)  BJW  "

Excused high BP for anything and everything because diovan always worked with another BP pill for me. All this started shortly after taking generic pills. Thank you for this forum. Going to Dr this a.m. to switch back. How dangerous this could be if valsartan is not the same as diovan. So ridiculous how expensive diovan was before generic came out. Wonder if price went down since generic is available now. "
"valsartan oral","Diovan","I have taken Diovan for perhaps 10 years without any side effects. Several months ago, I changed to Valsartan 320-mg because UnitedHealthCare no longer paid for Diovan -- the difference between Diovan and Valsartan is slightly more than $200 per month. Since taken Valsartan, I have tremendous aching in legs and shoulders."

Now on Valsartan 160 mg have headache, slightly blurry vision, cough, and b/p 157/95.  Maybe this Valsartan is a placebo of some sort because it doesn't seem to bring my b/p down.  Pharma says I have to take the Valsartan a month before allowing the Diovan back."
"valsartan oral","Diovan","My doctor switched me from Lisinopril to Valsartan because of continuing orthostatic events (faintness on standing but no fainting). Took Valsartan for 14 months before taking myself off the drug.

Orthostatic events continued on valsartan and worsened. I considered wearing a helmet!

Two or three months after beginning Valsartan I began experiencing ""many"" ectopic beats, PAC's and PVC's. I'd never before experienced PVC's but did not associate with Valsartan - thought I'd strained something exercising. A Polar exercise heart monitor at one point indicated 18.5% ectopic beats immediately after a night's sleep. 

Within 3 days of stopping Valsartan, the ectopic beats essentially disappeared. At two months after stopping Valsartan, I can't detect PAC's or PVC's. 

Over the last 18 months I've been exercising and lost about 50 lbs - my blood pressure has remained low, typically 100/65. The orthostatic events are getting rare, a few days between events now. On Valsartan(and Lisinopril), if I sat in a chair more than 15 minutes, I planned on being faint after standing.

After two months free of Valsartan, I'm beginning to think the drug was about to kill me. I am, perhaps incorrectly, viewing the arrhythmias as a ticket to sudden heart failure.

I don't recommend that anyone stop the drug without consulting their doctor. My doctor didn't seem concerned about what I was experiencing but I perceived severe quality of life issues. I was NOT suicidal. I monitored BP closely and figured I could start taking the drug again if BP rose excessively; it did not."
"User Reviews & Ratings - valsartan oral","Diovan","Converted fron Diovan to the generic Valsartan.  It's not lowering my BP at all.  I am taking 160 twice daily.  But it just does not effect my BP.

I have been off this medicine for over a week now but it still feels like it's in my system. I still have some dizziness and occasional heart pounding. This medicine almost cost me my life."
"valsartan oral","Diovan","I have taken Diovan for about five years, worked well, kept my BP within the normal range. Insurance switched to Valsartan less than a month ago and my BP is 160s/90s and 100s. I was only taking 80 mg of Diovan once a day. With Valsartan I doubled that when my BP was getting out of hand. My doctor now wants me to go to 320 mg of the Valsartan. I started that yesterday and have not seen a decrease in my BP yet. Just woke up with my heart POUNDING. Dangerous drug especially for someone who does not monitor their BP at home regularly. foot and hand discomfort is new since starting this. Tingling in my left arm and hand like there is no circulation. Headaches every day. Itchy all over but especially hands and feet. Definitely needs to be looked at again by the Feds.

I almost convinced myself this was Mal de Debarquement from my cruise in June because many of the symptoms match.

Daily life is almost unbearable. I was switched to Micardis for one day and the side effects were nearly the same except worse.

"losartan oral","Cozzar","Made me so dizzy I missed a week of work.  My doctor says that this is a result of lowering BP, but it's far more likely to be the dehydration it causes.  It also made me chronically fatigued, and depressed to point of suicidal ideation.   It also gave me chest pains and insomnia.  I've been off it a week now, and life is beautiful again.

Did not associate with the losarten until I was admitted to hospital with critically low potassium and they said my right lung was VERY congested.  This drug is not for me...my blood pressure went up after I was on it for a while.  My husband takes it with no problems.  I guess I'm just allergic to it.  I have stopped it."
"losartan oral","Cozzar","I was on Losartan POT 100mg for 3 weeks and my systolic went from 175 to 145-150. When I would speak to someone I would begin to cough and could not continue speaking. This did not appear to be a valid way to go through the rest of my life so I stopped taking the Losartan. I was also experiencing brain fog, extreme fatigue and a red rash on my forehead (for at least 5 years) before developing high BP. A friend suggested that I try going off all wheat products for several days to see if I might be gluten sensitive. I tried doing that. After 4 days the brain fog and fatigue went away; the rash went away after 7 days.  And, after 3 weeks my systolic BP reading went from 175 to 135-145.  After doing a great deal of research I determined that I was gluten sensitive (according to what I was reading in standard medical articles). However, many recent articles in the alternative news are pointing to glyphosate (Roundup) that is sprayed on most wheat crops just before harvesting because it causes the grains to become larger, giving a more profitable crop.  I sincerely believe it is the glyphosate poison (Roundup) applied to wheat just before harvesting that is causing many medical problems. I think it is the Roundup because I have a 60 year history of not being sensitive to gluten. "

I am dizzy in my head though. Its every 20 seconds or so and it hard to deal with. I have it all the time and even in bed if I wake up in the middle of the night. I really do not like this but with all the other blood pressure meds the side effects were way worse. I guess you have to take the good with the bad cause there is no one pill that doenst have side effects. I have headaches but that is a side effect too. So I guess every ones body is different and you will just have to decide which side effects you can deal with and which ones you cant.

"losartan oral","Cozzar","Had very bad reaction to this med. Was on for 5 days and lethargic, dizzy, sick to my stomach, gassey. Also had bad pains on right side of back. I felt like I had a very bad  bladder infection. I never had such a adverse reaction to a drug like this one. Went off the 6th day and took 3 days to feel a little better. Was on Diovan and Dr. changed to Losartan . Thought it would be less expensive for me, Although I have coverge for Diovan. He figured he was saving me $$ ..back on Diovan and no problems so far. This drug is very scary. I do not recommend it at all. Hope this review helps ."

"losartan oral","Cozzar","My 4 year old daughter is on this medication because she has had 2 heart surgeries before the age of 1 for a stenotic aortic valve and regurgitation and overall high blood pressure. She was first on Captopril and Enalapril which tasted better but caused breast buds to form which is a side effect for most blood pressure meds. For the most part Losartan works well.  Tastes horrible when it is compounded for a child. Works well overall. Noticed a dry hacking cough which is new for my child. Will get a second opinion. Not many small children are on this medication yet. Will keep posting."

Have been monitoring at home and am still in the 164/90 range and will be calling my GP on Tuesday after the holiday to see what to do.  Was previously on amlodipine with hydrochlorthiazide and I have had severe itching (dr says it is heat related internal hives???) that occurs after showering and I had really bad hot flashes, but at least my b/p was normal when taking it.  the itching seems to have subsided some, but the jury is out on the hot flashes.  I am concerned because I am on 100mg and it does not seem to be helping my b/p at all.  Also have developed leg pain behind my right knee, but not sure if the two are related.  Hope to get answers from Dr soon."
"losartan oral","Cozzar","My Doc. changed me from Lisinopril-HCTZ 20/25 to Losartan 25 and I feel great.  He said the beta blocker messes with your brain in some people, me included, plus I was having terrible shoulder pain and hip pain thinking I needed work done on my shoulders as well as a hip replacement.  I'm thinking clearer with more zest for life and my shoulders don't hurt nearly like they did.  Is Losartan an Ace inhibitor or a beta blocker?  My wife takes Lisinopril HCTZ 20/25 and cough's a lot since starting on it.  Is Lisinopril a different class drug than Losartan?  I'd like her to suggest to her Doc to try Losartin if it's the same class, please advise.  Thanks Gene"

"losartan oral","Cozzar","I was on the generic form of Cozaaar, Losartan, for 3 1/2 months.  The side effects I suffered included blurry vision, decreased sensitivity (fingertips most notably), dry skin, hair loss, water retention (which led to increased blood pressure), tinnitus, muscular pain and a metallic taste in my mouth.  My doctor did not know why my blood pressure was up, nor why I was retaining water, and prescribed a diuretic to go with the Losartan (Cozaar).  The metallic taste in my mouth led me to search the internet at length, and I finally came across a list of reported side effects that sounded like mine.  The day I stopped taking Losartan, my back/ neck pain went away completely.  I had been in excruciating neck pain for about a month.  I had no idea it was related to my medication.  Now, one week later, the metallic taste is gone, and my vision is getting clearer each day.  My sense of touch is improving, and I no longer retain water.  My blood pressure is so much better. I no longer need the ""reading glasses"" I had been using for the past 2 months. I went back to Benicar, and I will never use Losartan (Cozaar) again as long as I live on this earth. I believe I was headed towards the rare but deadly side effect of ""a condition that results in the breakdown of skeletal muscle tissue, leading to kidney failure.""  I am so thankful for the information I found online, which is why I am posting this.  I think the internet saved my life."
