"Norvasc oral","amlodipine","At first, when I started taking this drug(always generic), I liked it.  It had a calming effect -- like drinking camomile tea.  Then the drugstore switched brands, and I've had problems ever since.  I thought I was B12 deficient, and a lot of my symptoms were helped by taking 10mg a day, but I've had symptoms that I realize started with this drug.  They are severe tiredness (ok 1 minute, then it's like hitting a wall), dizziness, nausea, brain fog, asthma, wheezing, tightness of chest, chest pain, rapid heartbeat all the time, tremors, swelling and pain of hands and feet, shooting pains, itchy/crawling feeling, loss of balance, and hair loss.
My BP was 200/170 on many occasions, and has slowly come down to 110/79, but as my BP gets better my reaction to this pill gets worse -- particularly breathing.
My doctor just keeps concentrating on my BP and ignores my other complaints. (My insurance isn't too helpful either).  I'd like to lower my BP with diet and exercise, but with all my symptoms, it's very difficult.
I'm on 10mg, and now divide my pill in half, with a water pill at night.  It seems to help with the swelling and has really helped with keeping my BP at a low level all day with no big ups and downs.

"Norvasc oral","amlodipine","I've taken Norvasc 5mg since 9/07/2010.It's now 09/25/2010.On 09/10/10 Dr told me to double to 10mg.Still no change in bp.Avg 150/95.I don't believe they know what they're treating.I've always struggled with way too low BP avg 70/55. 08/19/2010, awoke with extremely swollen ankles & legs..4x in size. I went to the ER, they inverted my bed I peed a lot & my bp returned to 84/63 & swelling subsided without any meds so I went home.Drs thought it was bec I'd been sun all day drinking Gatorade doing a campaign for the prev 2wks.On 9/7/10, I felt like I was having a heart attack & my legs were again swollen.Went to ER, got admitted for 4days.Given Norvasc & inverted my bed.BP reduced to avg 130/70 @ discharge.They think it's the Norvasc that reduced it,I disagree. I think it was the lying down & inversion. Now I've been home Norvasc doesn't work. My bp avg is 150/98.I think we need to find out what's causing the spike from basement to penthouse. Only reduces when I lay & invert.Now Drs say swelling is because of Norvasc..I think it makes it worse but doesn't cause it. I tried telling idiot I came to ER bec of legs swollen 4x size b4 Norvasc It  increased my heartrate like it's about to beat out of my chest. It isn't helping, I intend to stop taking & research for natural ways to reduce bp.Unfortunately I believe there's some other reason bp spiked.I was also diagnosed with Hyponatremia & SIADH.I eat extremely healthy when I do eat, I have almost zero appetite. No salts, drink tons of water, no sodas, make my own fruit juices no processed foods, no high fructose corn syrup etc.I think doctors are treating the symptom without finding the cause for no appetite & swelIing I'm somewhat overweight from tons of steroids given after a recent car accident, but that didn't alter my unusually low bp.It's this sudden swelling & spiked bp that worries me.It never goes to moderate..from xtreme high to xtreme low. Today it averages 160/110 hrt rate 105.Now Dr wants to give betablockers?","9/25/2010 5:02:07 PM"

Several days later, both feet/ankles swelled up like balloons. Couldn't walk on them. Chest pounding. Hands also swelled and face became red and flushed. Worst part was my ears became clogged like I had a head cold and I developed a ringing in one ear. Took hours to fall asleep.

I was always fatigued, pain levels high in joints, and suffered from ibs/constipation, dry eyes and mouth. They even thought I had mixed connective tissue disease but test proved that wrong.
Well enter my new PCP and she decides to try this drug for a two week time trial.
I am a totally different person today. For years I was told I had arthritis or fibromyalgia. Well on Amlodipine I am urinating better than I have ever done before, no constipation, hardly any fatigue and the pain in my joints is minimal!!!!! for the first time in 13 years!  My husband is shocked! I am assuming that all this time I had fluid in those joints.  You couldn't even hug me!
The only side effect is that I only get 4 or 5 hours sleep but when I awake I'm not fatigued and get up and start my day with energy and enthusiasm.
I'd like to get my regular 7 hrs. of sleep in but maybe that will happen the longer 
I'm on the medication. 
I have just been given a new lease on life and at 63 it feels so good.
I realize this won't happen to everyone, the changes it has given me with my medical conditions but I was so disabled any change for the good is a blessing.

Cat has taken this for two and a half years and is 5yrs old. He is healthy on this and if he has been off the tablets for over 3 days he doesn't seem so well. The vet himself has medication for high blood pressure that is hereditary. As the vet is a fit middle aged man I suspect he'd researched medications for hypertension coming up with norvasc for himself and cat.Norvasc has the advantage of being a tablet able to be broken and a low dose option. Cat shows no side affects aside from a bit if stuff in his eye corners that is easily wiped off once a day. Vet said his eyes were fine, it was just a response to the Norvasc.Cat accepts his daily dosing well over the last year, earlier he was fairly co-operative with occasions of pretending to swollow with spitting it out when I wasn't looking. There was a time when in a month I hadn't given him the tablets regularily and he actually seemed eager to take them after a second period of missing them for 3 days.It looks like cat has associated feeling well with the daily ritual of being given the tablet.As the humans in cat's life cannot see any other observable side affects and cat isn't describing any it seems Norvasc is effective and safe.","4/26/2009 10:44:13 PM"

"Norvasc oral","amlodipine","I started with Norvasc, then started using the generic.  It's been pretty effective in combination with Hydrochlorothiazide. 

However, I have experienced some side effects, namely: blurred vision, weight gain (outside of my sedentary lifestyle), hair loss (mild), dizziness at times and also rapid heart beat at times.

I didn't realize any except the dizziness were associates with the drug, until I researched the side effects.  Also, studies show that those who take calcium/beta blockers are 2 1/2 times more likely to contract Type 2 diabetes! 

Basically, I'm in a weight/lifestyle management program now, including Curves gym, racquetball and fencing.  It's just not worth it to have HBP.  Lose the weight (if that is the cause of your HBP) and then God willing, you can lose the medication.

"Norvasc oral","amlodipine","Worked great for my high blood pressure and the generic is cheap, but it made me so exhausted I slept all the time and could not drive or hold a job while on it. If there is anything for high blood pressure that does not make you exhausted, I would like to know what it is. Beta blockers also made me groggy, but it took being on them 1-2 months before it built up enough in my body for the beta blocker (Inderal) to make me tired, so at first I did not attribute it to the Inderal. I also was very groggy on Diovan and Hydralazine. I quit eating at restaurants and fast food places and quit cooking with salt and although my BP is still high (134 over 84) it is much better than the 160 over 100 that it was before I changed my diet. So if BP meds make you feel drowsy, try cooking with seasonings like McCormicks Salt Free Herb mixes (in the Spice section at the grocery store) and check the mg of sodium on sauces you buy and use low salt or salt free bouillon (Wylers makes a good one that is a powder in a glass jar that you measure by the spoonful).","8/16/2008 4:21:39 PM"

"User Reviews & Ratings - Altace oral","ramipril","This medication has been HORRIBLE for me. A few years ago I was on it and developed major anxiety, sinus infections and cough. Severe on all levels. So went off the drug and those things went away... took a while for the anxiety to stop however.  About 5 months ago, my protein leak spiked so I tried this med again at 5 mg. After a couple of months cough, water weight gain (10 lbs), anxiety and major neck and shoulder pain. Went off of it. Dropped weight and pain and anxiety fairly fast... probably as I wasn't on it as long as first time. So a month after being off the Altace, protein spikes again. So thought I'd try low dose. 1.25. No effect on the protein leak but stopped losing weight immediately and neck and shoulder stiffness. Doubled the dose to 2.5 a week ago and within a couple days severe neck and shoulder pain and water retention.. started gaining even though I jog everyday and am on a calorie restricted diet. Today I have made the decision I can't take this med. At 2.5mg the protein is reduced but I am miserable. I am also major allergic to Atacand.. Angiodema caused vocal chords to swell and it took 5 weeks to heal after coming off that drug. So I have no proteinuria drugs I can take. Scary but this is not living life with all these side effects either.","1/12/2013 2:02:27 PM"

During  the first 2 months on the medication, I experienced occasional dry cough that didn't bother me.  Then I got the flu last year (Nov 08) and since then, my cough after taking Altace daily, has worstened and occurs mostly at night.  My PMD advised me to stop the med for 4 days to see if the cough subsided. It did. I started back on the Altace and the cough returned.  I use lozenges at night which help only slightly.  During the day now I am frequently clearing my throat as if I have post nasal drip which I have never experienced before being on this med. I will ask my cardiologist to reduce my dose to 1.25mg, then see if the symptoms persist.  This medication has been a Godsend as far as my cardiomyopathy is concerned, along with Toprol XL, and my pacemaker, I now have more energy, and feel so much better than I have felt in a long time.  The cardiac problem was not diagnosed until my Primary physician recommended a consult because my symptoms were thought to be related to MS, which was diagnosed 6 years ago. Probably both conditions existed simultaneously for several years (I was diagnosed with mitral valve prolapse more than 20years ago). I feel blessed and am ever greatful to all of my physicians because they saved my life.  I want to reap the benefits of Ace Inhibitors but if the symptoms persist, I will have to change meds.  The cough frightens me because it is spasmotic, so much so that I'm afraid that this causes more problems for my heart.

"Diovan oral","valsartan","I began taking Diovan 40mg 12.5 mg. hctz about 18 months ago. It controlled my bp well and seemed to have few side effects.  About 6 months ago I began having bouts of all over joint pain usually for short intervals. EVERY joint in my body would ache. Three weeks ago the pain became non stop and the intensity was unbearable.  I was tested for RA and Lupus, negative result.  My internist informally diagnosed with Fibromyalgia and recommend a rheumatologist if pain did not improve. At my regular cardio appt. I described my symptoms to him, he immediately took me off the drug to see if it would help.  6 days after discontinuing the meds I was virtually pain free and remain so another  week later. If you are diagnosed with fibro or suffer any of these symptoms after beginning the med find a doctor who willhelp you get off this and onto something else while you determine if your symptoms improve. I was on the lowest dose, so was able to stop immediately although this may not be recommended for higher dosages.","3/21/2014 8:41:06 PM"

"Diovan oral","valsartan","Thank God for these reviews. History, 5 bypasses twice in 1998 and 2000.  Multiple stents since then.  I have always been vert susceptible to side effects of all medications  Been on lisinipril for years and had the cough everyone knows about, it kept my BP at a consistent 95/55.  My pharmacy had filled my scrip with a different generic that didn't work well, I mentioned it to my Dr who recommended Diovan to alleviate the cough and add some benefits.  Took it for about 6 weeks and had gradually increasing  multiple symptoms I didn't even realize that were associated until reading online.  Eyes twitching, pain in feet and ankles, runny nose, suddenly very cold nose/hands/feet, weakness (that gradually got worse and worse, and more.
  Then the worst part came. Instant severe tiredness and palpitations that made me feel like my heart was stopping.  My blood pressure shot up especially the diastolic (lower number).  Called the dr who wanted me to monitor my BP during episodes and keep diovan but I said screw that.  I had some of the good lisinipril left, I changed immediately.  The most intense side effects disappeared right away although they repeated on and off for days even prompting me to go to the ER.  They had NO ANSWERS which ticks me off now since I had found all of the answers here.
  If you stop taking it expect the side effects to last for a lengthy period.  As I write this it has been 9 days and the effects linger although diminished.  Frankly I am feeling better in the last 20 minutes having read through this thread.  Yes, I understand anxiety can exacerbate the issue...and it had.","3/28/2014 12:52:56 PM"

"User Reviews & Ratings - Diovan oral","valsartan","Before anyone takes this drug, they should have a blood test for their ANA level to see if they have an autoimmune disorder.  In 2006, I had NO health issues, but I went to have a mole removed.  I was nervous and had a huge amount of caffeine (coffee and soda) during the day.  So when I got to the Dr. office in the afternoon my blood pressure was really high which I have since learned was because of the caffeine.  Anyway, she put me on Diovan which was new in 2006.  Within a month I started having swelling and pain in my joints.  My knees & ankles hurt and my hands were really swollen and painful.  My daughter told me these sounded like symptoms of Lupus which my dad was diagnosed with when he died in 1993.  When I mentioned this to the doc, she ran a blood test and my ANA was sky-high so I was diagnosed with Lupus and sent to a Rheumatolgist.  Fact is that even though my ANA may have been high, I had NO symptoms of Lupus until I took the Diovan.  I believe it triggered my Lupus symtoms.  I'm no longer on Diovan but now I take Plaquenil for Lupus. The Lupus symtoms didn't subside when I quit taking the Diovan.  Sure wish I had refused the blood pressure med back in 2006.","3/27/2013 8:43:14 PM"

BP went down from 170/90 to 120/70--perfect!
As we get older, our bodies suffer more and more irreparable damage from the environment.  You need to find out what is causing your BP to go up and fix it--not gloss over and chemically medicate it.  The American Heart Association is lying on it's website when they claim ""no one knows why a person has high blood pressure."" There are tons of studies out there on natural substances and fixing your diet (no sugar, low carb)to lower your BP, the better your blood sugar is, the better your blood pressure will be, in general.  Get a meter and use it.  Keep your blood sugar in the recommendations of the meter mfgr which are the same as the American Diabetes Assn.  Good luck to you all.","6/7/2011 12:12:35 PM"

"Diovan oral","valsartan","Overall I am happy with this drug, very little side effects in a couple years.  However, lately my body temperature is lower, almost 2 degrees and my legs and feet seems cold.  I am taking Diovan W/Hctz 160/12.5 orally.  So last week I was walking with my wife about 2 miles and half-way through the walk, my left leg got slightly num, like when you sleep on your arm and a felt fatique so my wife helped me home; anyhow this happen twice in a row on walks so I decided to make an appointment to see my doctor and couldn't get an appointment for (4) days so I decided to cut the diovan pill in half and took half and I felt better the next few days, no pain when I walk or numness.  When I told my doctor about this he examine me an ordered a circulation stress test, which I am taking on Thursday; however, he told me to start taking the pill again full strength and about an hour after taking the pill I felt cold all over and my wife took my temperature and it was 96.8 not 98.6.  So I am confused as to what is happening to me.  I feel I should only take half the medication again like when I first started out the drug with my doctor at 80 mgs.  I never have seen these symptons discuss with diovan oral tablet--what gives?  My wife says I should get a second opinion.","4/20/2011 12:37:08 AM"

My Dr. changed me over to Diovan 80mg once per day.  Within 2 hours started having terriable side effects.  After 3 days of treatment side effects included, choking feeling, pain in left arm and left calf, insomnea and when able to sleep, nightmares and a pounding heart.  I have been put back on Atacand and we are hoping that there is no damage just from the 3 days I was on this medication.  The cost of the Diovan and Atacand are very close.  So I guess I do not understand why it has to be a prior authorized now by my insurance, just because they have changed RX companies. People in offices are messing with my health!  And may have caused damage for a few dollars.  How much more will this cost to correct?  If able to correct! I know that Diovan works well for many people.  And I am thankful that it helps them, but if you are asked to change because of cost?  It is not worth it if you are well controlled on a different medication....

"Diovan oral","valsartan","I've been on the Diovan for awhile and it is working to lower the blood pressure.  Interesting, the doctors believe it's that ""White Coat Syndrome"" that's causing my problem, as I am deathly afraid of the doctor's office, anything to do with it, ever since my mom passed away.  Plus, I had a very traumatic experience, which I believe initiated my whole fear of the doctor.

Anyway, anyone who gets put on this stuff, stay with it, the side affects eventually subside, did for me!  You want to make sure you take care of yourself, eat well, exercise, get a good night's sleep, and you'll be fine.

"Diovan oral","valsartan","I forgot to mention something. In addition to improved diet and walking every day, I have been drinking apple cider vinegar in a glass of water once or twice a day. I can't say this has helped normalize my BP without meds, but I don't know that it hasn't. There are numerous websites describing the health benefits of ACV. Check for yourself. If you decide to try it, stir one or two tablespoons of raw organic unfiltered apple cider vinegar with ""mother"" into a full glass of water. (Mother is the name for the little cobwebby nutrients that float in the vinegar.) Bragg is a good brand. So is Hain. If you don't like the vinegar taste, stir in a little honey. I first started doing this to help my irritable bowel but it has the rep for controlling BP as well. Be patient and give it a few weeks; nothing will happen overnight. ","7/25/2009 7:00:28 PM"

I was amazed at how easy it was to normalize my BP by becoming more active and improving my diet. The most important thing I can say here is get off your rear and get moving! Walking is ideal because it is gentle and works almost all your muscles. Start out slow and build up gradually. Start your new program several weeks before attempting to reduce your meds, and then talk to your doc first.","7/24/2009 12:51:01 PM"

If you are plagued with side effects, that means your body hates the stuff and it probably isn't good for you. What good is artificially ""normal"" BP if it's causing so many other problems? People still have strokes & heart attacks while on BP meds.  Better to try to control it naturally and keep the body happy.  

Suggestion if BP meds are a must: Try low doses of 2 or even 3 meds rather than high doses of a single med. This is suggested by my cousin who is a pharmacist. He says doing this minimizes side effects.","7/16/2009 9:49:15 AM"

One very important fact about this drug is that it may not work well on African-Americans, of which I am one. So, it may not be advised that this drug be used because the natural inclination for the doctor is to 'up' to dosage when another drug might work better with a low dosage. Doctors are too quick to prescribe and then up dosages. This isn't good in the long run due to the effect that drugs have on the liver.","8/21/2009 2:58:25 PM"

I finally pulled/tore a ligament and muscle in my shoulder and needed Physical Therapy.  Through all of these sore backs and joints and muscles, I was taking Ibuprofen just to function in my daily life.  My doctor ran my blood tests and my liver function tests were bad.  Bad enough that she took me off of Diovan.  It was like a weight was lifted from my shoulders--within 2 days I could get out of bed without hobbling when I started to walk.  My back started to feel better. My shoulder began to heal.  I could exercise and not be sore for 3 days. I don't need Ibuprofen anymore. My normal energy level has returned. And my liver function tests are getting better.  
   I should have insisted that my doctor take me seriously when I told her my muscles and joints and back hurt and that the hurt was different from sore muscles, much sharper.

"User Reviews & Ratings - Atacand oral","candesartan","I was diagnosed with hypertension 5years ago and started medication with Micardes 80mg which at the start worked perfectly with truly low side effects but my blood pressure started to move up after 4years of Micardes. My doctor moved me to Micardes Plus which was quite good but for a short period of time. In one of the random checks my reading was 140/105 which triggered my doctor to give another medication in addition to the Micardis Plus but I never used it. I went to another doctor who replaced Micardis with Exforge. Oh God, was fatal on me with lots and lots of side effects. I thought I may die if I continued to use it then I tried the magical Atacand Plus. Frankly, it took sometime to work perfectly but now my readings is around 120/75 during the day and 105/65 at night. Very minimal side effects and feeling myself active and full of energy. I never saw those numbers (120/75) even in childhood. I hope it will continue to work well for me. Tip of advice, learn to calm down as much as possible, meditation and stay active as possible.

"User Reviews & Ratings - Atacand oral","candesartan","I had high blood pressure for years, was taking a medication and a diuretic, yet the BP was still too high. My friend encouraged me to see a cardiologist who helped her husband with his BP, and she prescribed Atacand, along with my other meds. For the first time, my BP was just great, and I have felt fine using it for the last few years. Now my health insurance doesn't have it on its ""favored"" list, and I would have to pay $100 for it vs. $10 or $50 for the drugs it has on its list.
I talked to my family dr. about it and she switched me to Diovan, which was the closest type of similar medication recommended by the health insurance.
This is my first month on Diovan, so I don't yet know how my BP is doing on this med. But I really don't feel quite the same, feel like I am having some palpitations, which I never had. Don't know whether it is just because I am paying more attention to it now, or is really due to the change in meds? Be happy if your insurance covers Atacand.

However, the other side effects, dry skin, anxiety, weakness, fatigue etc, in addition to those mentioned above and by other authors is very troubling.

I had to be taken off of those and the above combination was found effective.

"Cozaar oral","losartan","I used to take Diovan which worked great for me.  But I became allergic to the dye they color it with so had to stop.  So I've taken Losartan (generic Cozaar) for about a year and a half.  Had severe back pain.  Got to where I could hardly walk at times from the back pain. Had to miss a bit of work and incurred many chiropractor bills. Had to give up skating, riding my bike, spin class, weight training and all exercise because of the pain.  Since I couldn't do anything, I had a lot of weight gain and depression.  Doctors couldn't figure out my back problem and blamed it on arthritis.  After forgetting to take the Losartan during a long weekend, I realized the pain had gone away as of that Sunday night.  I quit the Losartan and have now been pain free for over 3 weeks.

Then atenolol which  slows the heart and reduces blood flow ...was a nightmare & it actually gave me nightmares , my arms and legs felt like they weighed a 1000 lbs, I had no energy, it was hard to focus & difficult to drive! Cozaar looks like  it might be next since the side affects for losarten the generic look like something I dont want to chance

"Cozaar oral","losartan","My Dr. has had me on 40/25 of Benicar HCT since Oct. of 2009. My BP had been 155/90, and it brought it down to low 100's/ high 60's...sometimes being VERY low! As of Dec 2009, I started cutting the pill in half , taking it in the morning with my other meds. I did this(without informing my Dr., but did my husband) because I had such EXTENSIVE fatigue it wasn't funny. Also had runny nose, dizziness, higher blood sugar, joint pain along with going to the bathroom nearly every hour! Once I cut these suckers in half, it took about a week, I did notice a big difference in my energy level & sex drive and my BP stayed down! At the beginning of January this year, my insurance co. said that they are no longer covering the Benicar & so my Dr., gave me samples of Mycardis...which I researched & decided that the side effects were NOT something I wanted to tolerate.So I started doing my own research on which high blood pressure meds I felt I could deal with, and finally found Cozaar...very few side effects listed & the reviews here were pretty encouraging. I told him what I had done as far as researching a BP med for myself & he said ""Oh darling, the BP meds ARE ALL THE SAME!"" Like hell they are! Then he proceded to give me more samples of Hyzaar...which I refused...so he reluctantly wrote me a script to start me on a LOW DOSAGE (which I also insisted on!) Anyway I'll be filling it this weekend, so we'll see where this takes me! I strongly urge everyone...DO YOUR RESEARCH!!! ALL BP MEDS ARE ...NOT...THE SAME!!! YOU ARE...The person putting these meds in your own body! BE Responsible for your own health!!! I'll give an update in a couple of weeks. Thanks","2/2/2010 11:15:57 AM"

So now I am older and have gained weight back, not exercising, and was at the dentist getting tooth pulled 3 days ago and they checked my BP and the lowest reading out of 3 was 170/110! I didn't ask what the other 2 readings were, but he was very concerned. My dentist went ahead and pulled the tooth but urgently advised me to go straight to my Dr. to get back on meds. So I went about 2 hours later, they checked it to be only 10 points lower, 170/100. He put me back on the Cozzar, have been on it for 3 days now, no side effects as of today. I have noticed though I am not as sluggish as I was before. I have been eating healthy and exercising again, walking on my lunch break at work and walking in my neighborhood in the evenings, or on treadmill.I am scheduled to see my dr. again in 5 more days to see how I am doing.

I had no side effects at all before when I was on Cozzar years ago. For those of you that are taking something different than Cozzar, if it is an ""ACE INHIBOTOR"" the cough you have is a side effect. I use to be on something differet before Cozzar, was on it for about 3 and a half years,had the cough, and when I switched doctors, I talked to this new dr. and he looked at my chart and seen what I was taking and switched me to Cozzar, and in 3 days cough was gone!!

It did not controll my BP  but it did make it go up & down. Not good.....
Here lately  the cough has gotten so bad that it produces flem, I saked my doctor to let me try something different & she put me on cozaar.
I have only took one dose but I Swear I feel better already, once again I have only took one dose 50 mg  once a day but I swear I feel better already.
I am going to come back in a week & then in a month to give an update of my experience with this drug , I only hope & pray that the cough from that wretched LISINOPRIL goes away.
Stay the heck away from lisinopril it does not controll hypertension it only masks the symptoms of it ,makes you cough & fools you into believing it is working.
No wonder it is so cheap, they know that you will keep using it to save money, I am sure the Health insurance companies love it, mine does.
Wish me luck.

'Fortunately' in my mother's case she was never driving at the time but cracked various bones due to 'random falls'. She reported the falls for YEARS to her GP who didn't investigate them. ""One minute I was up, the next, on the floor."" Mum repeatedly reported.

I moved back in with Mum to get to the bottom of it.

After bullying Mum's GP, she agreed to a reduced dose trial (100mg > 50mg) The effect was dramatic. Mum's BP went from the 'upper limit' to the lower limit - seemingly an overdose.
Having got her BP WELL DOWN, another doctor agreed a further drop to 25mg. Mum's BP went up again but was still under where it was at 100mg.
*I* stopped Mum taking it altogether. For 6 months, Mum never had another fall and her BP was high but below the 'limit' - in other words, she didn't need losartan potassium at all.

The HCTZ worked well at first, keeping me around 120/80, but my BP had crept back up. The Lisinipril worked great for BP, dropping it to under 120/80 after 3 weeks, but gave me a cough, dry mouth and made arthritis, heal pain, and pain from a recent knee injury worse. I had horrible night cramps, not just in the calves, but upper thighs as well. He switched me to Cozaar 50mg. Within 3 days, the cough stopped, knee and leg pain stopped, and heal pain (which I have had for 10 years) is minimal. And continual fatigue has stopped. I went for a long hike today, something I haven't been able to do pain-free for years. I called him the other day to complain about the cost - waiting for him to call me back. Well, apparently, it's an anti-depressant as well. I was feeling like every day was ""ground hog day"", and that is gone as well. (Might have something to do with the loss of the pain...)

"Cozaar oral","losartan","Had borderline high blood pressure, now down to normal. Also have hypothyroidism (doc misread thyroid blood test in 1987...always ask for blood work copies!!!)which led to 140 pound weight gain over 7 years and subsequently Type II diabetes with Restless Leg Syndrome. Mirapex for RLS coupled with Cozaar can lead to fainting as both have this side effect. For me it is especially bad on hotter days. Have had many UTI's that always travel to kidneys by the time I find out (no pain in bladder). Have almost constant hip/lower back pain since starting this and causes a severe lack of sleep (4-5 hours per night). Have frequent headaches and other muscles tend to get sore/tight very easily. I also take metformin, glypizide and Byetta (have lost 45 pounds since Nov.). I have an increased red rash under the skin from the cozaar and have a rare side effect from metformin which is a severe sensitivity to sunlight/sunburn. Hopefully with a little more weight loss both the diabetes and tendency to higher blood pressure will disappear entirely along with the side effects.","5/9/2008 2:37:21 AM"
"Cozaar oral","losartan","just beware~~~ on new year's eve of this year (08), my blood pressure got pretty high. (AND NO ALCOHOL)  i had not taken cozaar for about 5 days because we went out of town before my Rx was ready.  i took 1- 100mg tablet.  OMG! about 12:15 a.m. new year's day i walked into the kitchen for a cookie before bed. well, i got to the cookies~~~ next i knew i was waking up on the floor looking up at the ceiling.  Managed to get myself up, only to wake up to the ceiling again.  this time i awoke in GREAT PAIN!  My husband helped me (gingerly) to my chair.  we took my BP~~~55/33!!!! An ER nurse wanted me to come on in.... on new year's eve???  NO WAY!!!
after giving my foot 3 more days to improve i decided to find out what was wrong. well,
3 fractured metatarsals in my left foot!
after casting, walking in a boot and still complaining about pain with walking at 4 months, i ended up having foot surgery last week to reset the bone with a plate and screws.
this is to warn those taking this drug~~~ do not restart the drug at FULL STRENGTH!
1/2 the pill would have been safer as i've learned from experience. you can always take more if 1/2 doesn't do the trick, but please don't make the mistake i did!","5/1/2008 7:40:52 PM"

I am a 61 yr. old, six feet tall, average weight of 195 lbs. white male, with a family history of hypertension, both mother and father. The down side of taking both medications for me is a daily sluggish feeling that can be overcome, but not without pushing myself through it.
